                  I came from China. After I finished my undergraduate studies,
                  I chose to study abroad. I completed a graduate program in
                  design at Kyushu University. At the same time, my research
                  focused on using machine learning to uncover data patterns on
                  social networking platforms and exploring approaches to
                  present them in an engaging and easy-to-understand way.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For the past few years, I have been learning and researching
                  user experience design, user interface design, and modern
                  JavaScript-based web development. I love the design and am
                  excited about new technologies. I have always believed that
                  design and development are inseparable, and their creative
                  collaboration leads to better solutions.
