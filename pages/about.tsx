                  I came from China. After I finished my undergraduate studies,
                  I chose to study abroad. I completed a graduate program in
                  design at Kyushu University. At the same time, my research
                  focused on using machine learning to uncover data patterns on
                  social networking platforms and exploring approaches to
                  present them in an engaging and easy-to-understand way.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For the past few years, I have been studying user experience
                  design, user interface design, and modern JavaScript-based web
                  development. I love the design and I&apos;m excited about new
                  technologies. I have always believed that design and
                  development is one thing, and that their creative
                  collaboration is the way to create better solutions.
